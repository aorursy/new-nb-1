# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

from subprocess import check_output
print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

#data = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv',index_col=0)
data = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')
features = list(data.columns.values)
features.remove('TARGET')
X = data[features]
y = data['TARGET']
# Import the random forest package
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier 

# Create the random forest object which will include all the parameters
# for the fit
forest = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators = 100)

# Fit the training data to the Survived labels and create the decision trees
forest = forest.fit(X,y)

print(forest.feature_importances_)
